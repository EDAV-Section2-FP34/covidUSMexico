To exemplify this, here we implement visualize_missings on the inflation data for Mexico from 2019 to 2021, and the US from 2012 to 2021 (monthly frequency). library(dplyr) library(tidyr) source(&quot;missing_visualization.R&quot;) inflation_mx &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Data/Inflation_MX_2019_2021.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = F) inflation_us &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Data/Inflation_US_2012_2021.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = F) visualize_missings(inflation_mx) visualize_missings(inflation_us) Thus, we then proceed to showcase visualize_missings on the example dataset: visualize_missings(fivethirtyeight::steak_survey,T) visualize_missings(fivethirtyeight::steak_survey,F) We can observe that rows without NAs are the most frequent, accounting for around 60% of them. hhold and steak_prep are the variables with the highest percentage of missing values, having around 20% each. Also interesting to note is the fact that when there are NAs in educ, there are also NAs in region, age and female, indicating that such variables come in batch.
