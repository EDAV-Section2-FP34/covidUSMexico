It represents an unexpected and unprecedented event that affected the whole world as a whole. Despite the common treat it represented (and still represents) for the entire world, individual countries tackled the pandemic with different approaches and policies. Such heterogeneity in government decisions led to variability on the pandemics effect in specific countries. While it is a fact that every country suffered negative health and economic outcomes, the main question that interests us is who did it better?. In this project we will focus on this question for the specific case of Mexico and the United States. Specifically, we are interested in studying the main differences we could identify. To that end, we will postulate the following questions: Which economy suffered t he most during the pandemic? Whats a good metric to measure economic and financial impact? Which country lagged the most in its recovery? How strong is the relationship between public health and economic conditions in each country? On a holistic approach, which government designed the most effective public policies to deal with the pandemic and the following economic fallout?

To exemplify this, here we implement visualize_missings on the inflation data for Mexico from 2019 to 2021, and the US from 2012 to 2021 (monthly frequency). library(dplyr) library(tidyr) source(&quot;missing_visualization.R&quot;) inflation_mx &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Data/Inflation_MX_2019_2021.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = F) inflation_us &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Data/Inflation_US_2012_2021.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = F) visualize_missings(inflation_mx) visualize_missings(inflation_us) Thus, we then proceed to showcase visualize_missings on the example dataset: visualize_missings(fivethirtyeight::steak_survey,T) visualize_missings(fivethirtyeight::steak_survey,F) We can observe that rows without NAs are the most frequent, accounting for around 60% of them. hhold and steak_prep are the variables with the highest percentage of missing values, having around 20% each. Also interesting to note is the fact that when there are NAs in educ, there are also NAs in region, age and female, indicating that such variables come in batch.
