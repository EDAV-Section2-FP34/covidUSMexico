It represents an unexpected and unprecedented event that affected the whole world as a whole. Despite the common treat it represented (and still represents) for the entire world, individual countries tackled the pandemic with different approaches and policies. Such heterogeneity in government decisions led to variability on the pandemics effect in specific countries. While it is a fact that every country suffered negative health and economic outcomes, the main question that interests us is who did it better?. In this project we will focus on this question for the specific case of Mexico and the United States. Specifically, we are interested in studying the main differences we could identify. To that end, we will postulate the following questions: Which economy suffered t he most during the pandemic? Whats a good metric to measure economic and financial impact? Which country lagged the most in its recovery? How strong is the relationship between public health and economic conditions in each country? On a holistic approach, which government designed the most effective public policies to deal with the pandemic and the following economic fallout? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Health data 2.2 Macroeconomic data 2.3 Financial data", " Chapter 2 Data sources The data that we will use in the project can be categorized in three verticals: Health data: Consisting of positive cases, deaths, vaccination and policy implementation. Macroeconomic data: Consisting of economic growth by sector and the inflation rate. Financial data: Consisting of market indices. 2.1 Health data 2.2 Macroeconomic data 2.2.1 Economic Growth Team member Abel Perez consulted economic growth data for Mexico from https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/indicadores/?tm=0 , in specific, he consulted the monthly approximation to GDP (which is quarterly) known as the Global Economic Activity Indicator (IGAE in spanish). These data also present information about the production in different economic activities know as primary, secondary and third activities. The data was preliminary cleaned in Excel sheets (deleting comments on top of the data) and processed as presented in Chapter 3. The data spans from January 2019 to September 2021 (33 observations), and after cleansing it contains the annual percentage change on economic activity for total, primary, secondary and thrid activities. ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 33 obs. of 5 variables: ## $ Periodo : int 201901 201902 201903 201904 201905 201906 201907 201908 201909 201910 ... ## $ Total : num 1.376 0.984 1.032 -1.554 -0.467 ... ## $ Primarias : num -0.506 5.894 1.829 -1.581 -1.57 ... ## $ Secundarias: num -0.4008 -0.0918 -0.0231 -2.9824 -3.3431 ... ## $ Terciarias : num 2.387 1.276 1.517 -0.855 0.995 ... For the US, he consulted the monthly GDP from https://ihsmarkit.com/products/us-monthly-gdp-index.html . This data do not include detail on the production of primary, secondary and third activities. Furthermore the definition of such activities changes between mexico and the US. To tackle this problem, he consulted Mexicos aggregation of economic activities from https://www.banxico.org.mx/SieInternet/consultarDirectorioInternetAction.do?sector=2&amp;accion=consultarCuadro&amp;idCuadro=CR199&amp;locale=es . he then consulted the proportion of contribution of sub-economic activities in the US from https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=150&amp;step=2&amp;isuri=1&amp;categories=gdpxind and aggregated the activities based on the definition in Mexico to compute weights for primary, secondary and third activities in the US based on Mexicos definition. Finally, we simply multiplied such weights to the total GDP in the US to obtain the production for activities and then compute the annual percentage change (all this process is documented in the code of Chapter 3). The data for US spans from January 2019 to September 2021 (33 observations), and has the same variables as in Mexicos data ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 33 obs. of 5 variables: ## $ OBS : int 201901 201902 201903 201904 201905 201906 201907 201908 201909 201910 ... ## $ Total : num 4.63 3.93 4.22 3.96 3.73 ... ## $ Primarias : num 0.125 -0.552 -0.268 -1.672 -1.885 ... ## $ Secundarias: num 3.65 2.95 3.24 1.27 1.05 ... ## $ Terciarias : num 5.03 4.32 4.62 4.94 4.71 ... 2.2.2 Inflation Team member Abel Perez consulted the data for inflation in Mexico from the Central Bank of Mexicos System of Economic Inormation (https://www.banxico.org.mx/SieInternet/consultarDirectorioInternetAction.do?accion=consultarCuadro&amp;idCuadro=CP154&amp;locale=es). The monthly Index for Consumer Prices was downloaded and inflation was computed in an auxiliar Excel sheet as the annual precentage change of the Index. The data of the Index of Cosumer Prices for the US was consulted in a similar manner from US Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost) and inflation was computed in the same way. The data for Mexican inflation we consulted spans from January 2019 to October 2021, consisting of 34 observations: ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 34 obs. of 3 variables: ## $ Month : chr &quot;01/01/2019&quot; &quot;01/02/2019&quot; &quot;01/03/2019&quot; &quot;01/04/2019&quot; ... ## $ INPC : num 103 103 103 104 103 ... ## $ Annual_Inflation: num 0.0437 0.0394 0.04 0.0441 0.0428 ... The data for US inflation spans from January 2012 to October 2021 (we will only focus on the intersection of time windows with Mexico), consisting of 118 observations: ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 118 obs. of 4 variables: ## $ Year : int 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 ... ## $ Month : chr &quot;Jan&quot; &quot;Feb&quot; &quot;Mar&quot; &quot;Apr&quot; ... ## $ Price : num 227 228 229 230 230 ... ## $ inflation: num 0.0293 0.0287 0.0265 0.023 0.017 ... 2.3 Financial data For this category of variables, team member Gilberto Garcia used the R package tidyquant, which connects to number of data sources including Yahoo Finance, Morningstar, Quandl, FRED Economic Data and more, to download the data in a format compatible with tidyverse. The code used to download this data can be found here. In the case of the United States, given that there are plenty of well maintained financial data sources, we decided to pick the S&amp;P 500 index as a representative proxy of the health of the American financial market, and also obtained data on the 11 sectors making up the index: Materials Health Care Consumer Staples Consumer Discretionary Energy Financials Industrials Technology Utilities Real State Communication Services In the case of Mexico there was a natural limitation, which is that the size of the Mexican financial market is much smaller in terms of number of companies and market capitalization. As a reference, the √çndice de Precios y Cotizaciones (IPC), the only Mexican stock index, is composed of around 35 publicly traded companies. We gathered data on this index, but were unable to obtained sectorized data because of this limitation. The API we used downloaded these data as a data frame with 9,671 observations and 8 columns. The columns correspond to the following variables: symbol (ticker), date, open price of trading day , highest price of trading day , lowest price of trading day , closing price of trading, volume of trading, and finally and most Finally, for the purposes of making value comparison across countries, we downloaded data on the exchange rate between the Mexican Peso and the US dollar. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation We now proceed to transform the macroeconomic data for the two countries "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Our data consists of macroeconomic and financial information that dont contain missing values, mainly due to the structured nature of such information. To exemplify this, here we implement visualize_missings on the inflation data for Mexico from 2019 to 2021, and the US from 2012 to 2021 (monthly frequency). library(dplyr) library(tidyr) source(&quot;missing_visualization.R&quot;) inflation_mx &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Data/Inflation_MX_2019_2021.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = F) inflation_us &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Data/Inflation_US_2012_2021.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = F) visualize_missings(inflation_mx) visualize_missings(inflation_us) Thus, we then proceed to showcase visualize_missings on the example dataset: visualize_missings(fivethirtyeight::steak_survey,T) visualize_missings(fivethirtyeight::steak_survey,F) We can observe that rows without NAs are the most frequent, accounting for around 60% of them. hhold and steak_prep are the variables with the highest percentage of missing values, having around 20% each. Also interesting to note is the fact that when there are NAs in educ, there are also NAs in region, age and female, indicating that such variables come in batch. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Which economy suffered the most during the pandemic? 5.2 Relation between public health and economic conditions in each country 5.3 Which economy better policies?", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Which economy suffered the most during the pandemic? 5.1.1 Health Vertical Th first thing that comes to mind when thinking the pandemics effect in a particular country are daily infection cases. In order to compare such infections between countries, here we present a time-series plot to compare daily cases in each country. To make the comparison fair among the two countries, we present the cases per 100,000 population from 2020-01-25 to 2021-11-27. For visualization purposes, we compute the 7-day moving average of the series. We can observe that the US consistently reports more infection cases per capita than Mexico. US also shows evidence of more waves than Mexico: two little waves before 2020-08-11, in a period in which Mexico only experienced one, and another little wave directly after the big 2020 winter wave. Despite the previous, both countries follow a somewhat similar trend in the three big waves that we may categorize as the initial wave with peak around July 2020, the 2020 winter wave, and the most recent wave with peak around August 2021. We now focus on what can be considered as the most important severity indicator in the pandemic: number of deaths. In the same spirit of the previous comparison, here we present daily death per Daily deaths per 10 million population. We can appreciate an interesting behavior. Unlike the reported active cases, deaths per capita are similar between the two countries, whith one being on top of the other only momentarily. Here we can see with more influence the effect of the three waves in both countries. In the first one, US started having more deaths earlier than Mexico, but was surpased by it around early July 2020 until the second wave in winter 2020 increased the deaths with more acceleration in the US but it was followed shortly after by Mexico. Unlike the first to waves when the US preceded Mexico, in the third one it was Mexico the country that started suffering the death toll earlier, and it was followed shortly after by the US. Both countries suffered similar death tolls across the pandemic but the US had more reported infection cases. This may be explained by the US having better healthcare system and coverage, something that Mexico may lack making infections more likely to end in a regrettable death. 5.1.2 Economic and Financial Vertical We first turn our attention to annual economic growth of the two countries. In Figure 3 we display the monthly series of annual percentage change of GDP for Mexico and the US from January 2020 to September 2021. We can see that prior to March 2020, both economies had a steady economic growth (in the case of Mexico, there was a recession actually), and when the governments decided to close interaction activities, the production in the US droped to negative levels and actually tied the decrease in Mexico, so we can say the US was the economy that reacted the most at the beginning, from 4.42% to -1.38% (Mexico moved from -0.107% to -2.17% in the same period). However, Mexico was the country that suffered the greatest downfall in production across the time window, with a huge -22.86% growth in March and a consistently less growth in the following months, except for May and June 2021, where the arithmetic effect of having a small production one year ago (first wave of the pandemic), will make the high growth seem as product of an increase of the current production when it is actually due to a devastating decrease of the past one. It is worth nothing that it was only in the begining of the pandemic that both economies suffered such an unprecedented decrease, as the second and third waves around winter 2020 and August 2021 (see Fig. 2) did not have the same impact as the first. The is may be explained due to the closing policies being more relaxed after the first tight lockdown, something we will explore in section 5.3. We now turn attention on the impact f the pandemic at sublevels of economic activities. To analyze with more detail the difference in impact between countries, we compute the difference in growth, that is \\(\\Delta US_k - \\Delta MX_k\\) where \\(\\Delta US_k\\) represents the annual growth in the US for economic activity \\(k \\in\\) (primary, secondary, tertiary). We see in all cases the difference in growth has median greater than 0, which tells us about a greater recession in Mexico than in US. Tertiary activities show the greatest difference with a median difference of more than 5 percentage points, which indicates that the US has greater resilience in all sectors, but specially in service activities. It is worth noting that primary and secondary activities have the first quartile less than 0, indicating that around 25% of the times, Mexico showed a higher economic growth during the pandemic. This speaks of an economy that focuses more in extraction of raw materials and manufacturing than in services, when compared to US standards. We now turn our attention to inflation and its relation to economic activity, to see the effects of the pandemic in the prices of each economy from January 2020 to September 2021. We can see that the initial lockdown decreased both the economic growth and inflation rate in the two countries, this is a natural consequence of less activity implying less demand for products and services and as such, a decrease in prices and in inflation. However, as the economic growth (dashed lines) started increasing, product of the reopening of both economies around June 2020, the inflation increased to levels higher than before the pandemic, and even when the economic activity started decreasing after June 2021 towards its pre-pandemic state, the inflation still seems to be in a positive trend. In this case again, Mexico is the country experiencing harder consequences as inflation is consistently higher than in the US, and the last observed months (August to September 2021), show a greater slope than the US. We now will turn to analyzing the performance of the financial variables throughout the evolution of the pandemic. Given that we have sectorized of the US stock market, we decided to create a heat map of these sectors to see which aspect of economic activity was perceived to be most affected by market participants. We can observe that energy was the sector most impacted by the pandemic as governments soon started imposing travel restrictions which greatly diminished the outlook for the price of oil in the following months. This expectation came to be realized as the enegy index is the only sector of the S&amp;P 500 that has not recovered its pre-pandemic level. In addition, we can also observe that the Technology sector not only has been the most resilient during the pandemic, but has had a strong rally during the pandemic, something that is explained by the strong demand of IT hardware and services as companies had to migrate to a remote work environment. Finally, something that come as a surprise to us was the relatively strong performance of the sector of Consumer Discretionary products. This sector tracks companies delivering goods and services that are considered non-essential by consumers, but desirable if their available income is sufficient to purchase them. Representative companies within this sector are Amazon, Home Depot, McDonalds, Nike and Lowes. Although at first glance one would have thought that people would prioritize savings over non-essential consumption, the massive financial aid programs that went into effect seem to have supported discretionary spending by American households. 5.2 Relation between public health and economic conditions in each country We first focus on the impact the pandemic had in the economic activity of the two countries. For this, we display scatterplots of economic growth vs monthly deaths for the two countries, and estimate a regression line in order to asses the level of association between what can be seen as the hardest severity indicator of the pandemic, and the overall economic outlook of a country. We also print the estimated \\(\\beta_1\\) coefficient that relates the death counts to the economic growth. We can see that the fitted line in both cases shows a negative trend, indicating that higher the deaths, lower the economic growth. The estimated \\(\\beta_1\\) coefficient for mexico is greater in absolute value, pointing out that for this country the economic fallout was worse. 5.3 Which economy better policies?
